				<p>
				I grew up in the east side of Atlanta -- me and my mom. And while it's not the toughest place in the world, it's dog-gone not the best place -- that's for sure. 
				I really didnt know I was gonna get to this point in my life just from the area I came from. Cause its not a prominent thing that you see people make it this level, in this sport -- especially this confrence. I was just playing for the love of the game.
				</p>

				<p>I have a tattoo on my right forearm that say's "Us against the world." It was one of the first tattoos that I got -- because growing up it was just me and my mom... always. Her problems became my problems and mine became hers. And it was all of the tough situations that we had to endure and go through that really made me the man I am today.

				Growing up, my mom was my mother and my father. And although every guy wants their dad to come to the games to cheer them on and critique them, I never had that. 

				Nobody knew our circumstances -- but my mother always made sure that I got what other kids in a two parent household got. She made sure that I was never un-taken care of, no matter what. Whether that was preparing home cooked meals, or waking up to boil water so that I had a hot bath. 

				<p>
				Everything that I've been through has led to the point i'm at today. I'm just trying to make the most of it...
				And records, they're nice and they're important. But it's all about how you treat people.
				When I leave here, I dont want anyone to have any negative thing to say about me -- because no matter if you won the Heisman or the National Championship, Georgia was here before I got here and Georgia will be here long after i'm gone.


				I just want people to remember me for what I am: a good, genuine person.
